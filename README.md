# Updated-Portfolio

So this is my updated portfolio using a bootstrap template.

So as far as installation goes, you need first and foremost Github; you need to download Visual Studio Code so you can write your code for HTML pages as well as your CSS and GitBash if you have Windows and Terminal for Mac owners because it makes it easier to commit, pull and push to your Github and locate your directories and repositories. You will also need Bootstrap as that is where you will be downloading your template from. Everything you need is pretty much laid out and done for you when using a bootstrap template as that is the point for "pre-built" CSS frameworks.

I would like to give all the credit to first and foremost, StartBootstrap.com, and Google. I had to test out a lot on google using the free tools (inspect) they provide, in order to modify my code.

I could not get my img to round out, couldn't figure out why by the end of it all so yeah, I'm going to need to work on that still!
